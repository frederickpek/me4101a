# Pedagogical Simulation of Graph Algorithms

Graph algorithms are an abstract subject in computer science, often making it a difficult subject to learn and teach. The goal of this project is to produce interactive online simulations for some basic graph algorithms (e.g., breadth-first search, depth-first search, Dijkstra's, Bellman-Ford, etc.) for use as pedagogical aids.
